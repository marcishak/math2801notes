# math2801notes


These are my statistics notes. They're unfinished ðŸ˜¢ (and probably will never be). Nevertheless, I hope you find them useful.

You can view them on the web [here](https://marcishak.github.io/math2801notes). 


They are written in [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) which has inbuilt support for LaTeX, on top of being able to add R code in "chunks" and export in HTML and pdf. However, due to the table in Chapter 3 and embedded images, the notes really only work formatting wise as a webpage.

The notes themselves also include a bit of MATH2901 content, most notably the end of Chapter 5 which has an interactive bivariate distribution (done in R and [plot.ly](https://plot.ly/r/).
